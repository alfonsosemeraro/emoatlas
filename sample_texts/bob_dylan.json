Them old dreams are only in your head.\"\n\nI said, \"Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!\"\nHe said, \"Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!\"\nHe grabbed my arm, I said \"Ouch!\"\nAs I landed on the psychiatric couch.\nHe said, \"Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,\nIt was all over by a quarter past.\nI was down in the sewer with some little lover\nWhen I peeked out from a manhole cover,\nWondering who turned the lights on us.\n\n\"Well, I got up and I walked around,\nUp and down the lonesome town.\nI stood wondering which way to go.\nI lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.\nIt was a normal day.\n\n\"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell\nAnd I leaned my head and I give a yell:\n'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'\nShotgun fired and away I ran.\nI don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.\n\n\"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,\nI seen a man.\nI said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'\nHe screamed a bit and away he flew.\nThought I was a communist.\n\n\"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,\nI said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'\nTook her by the hand and my heart was thumping,\nShe said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?\nYou seen what happened last time they started.'\n\n\"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.\nThere was nobody around.\nI got into the driver's seat\nAnd I drove down Forty-second Street,\nIn my Cadillac.\nGood car to drive, after a war.\n\n\"Well, I remember seeing some ad\nSo I turned on my Conelrad.\nBut I didn't pay the Con Ed bill\nSo the radio didn't work so well.\nTurned on my record player.\nIt was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,\n'Tell your ma, tell your pa,\nOur loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'\n\n\"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,\nI needed somebody to talk to.\nSo, I called up the operator of time\nJust to hear a voice of some kind.\n'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'\nShe said that for over an hour and I hung up.\"\n\nWell, the doctor interrupted me just about then,\nSaying, \"Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.\nBut mine was a little different, you see.\nI dreamt the only person left after the war was me.\nI didn't see you around.\"\n\nWell, now, time passed and now it seems\nEverybody's having them dreams.\nEverybody sees hisself\nWalking around with no one else.\n\"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time.\"\nI think Abraham Lincoln said that.\n\"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours.\"\nI said that."

  "text": "Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,\nWe ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,\nAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,\nSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,\nFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,\nFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\nAnd for each and every underdog soldier in the night,\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nThrough the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\nWith faces hidden as the walls were tightening,\nAs the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,\nDissolved into the bells of the lightning,\nTolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,\nTolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,\nTolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nThrough the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,\nThe sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,\nThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,\nLeaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,\nStriking for the gentle, striking for the kind,\nStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,\nAnd the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nIn the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\nFor the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,\nTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,\nAll down in taken-for-granted situations,\nTolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,\nFor the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,\nFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nEven though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared\nAnd the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,\nElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\nCondemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,\nTolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,\nAnd for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.\n\nStarry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,\nAs we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,\nSpellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,\nTolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,\nFor the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,\nAnd for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing."

Her skin, it was bronze.\nWith the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.\nI courted her proudly, but now she is gone,\nGone as the season she's taken.\n\nIn a young summer's youth, I stole her away\nFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stay.\nEach one of them suffering from the failures of their day,\nWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.\n\nOf the two sisters, I loved the young.\nWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.\nThe constant scapegoat, she was easily undone\nBy the jealousy of others around her.\n\nFor her parasite sister I had no respect.\nBound by her boredom, her pride to protect,\nCountless visions of the other she'd reflect\nAs a crutch for her scenes and her society.\n\nMyself, for what I did I cannot be excused.\nThe changes I was going through can't even be used\nFor the lies that I told her in hope not to lose\nThe could-be dream lover of my lifetime.\n\nWith unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip\nA magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,\nNoticing not that I'd already slipped\nTo the sin of love's false security.\n\nFrom silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,\nAnswers of emptiness, voice vacancies\nTill the tombstones of damage read no questions but, \"Please,\nWhat's wrong? What's exactly the matter?\"\n\nAnd so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,\nThe timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.\nAt the peak of the night the king and the queen\nTumbled all down into pieces.\n\nThe tragic figure. her sister did shout,\n\"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!\"\nAnd I, in my armor, turning about\nAnd nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.\n\nBeneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,\nHer sister and I in a screaming battleground.\nAnd she in between, the victim of sound,\nSoon shattered as a child to the shadows.\n\nAll is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!\nI gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.\nMy mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,\nLeaving all of love's ashes behind me.\n\nThe wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.\nThe words to say \"I'm sorry\" I haven't found yet.\nI think of her often and hope whoever she's met\nWill be fully aware of how precious she is.\n\nAh, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,\n\"How good-how good does it feel to be free?\"\nAnd I answer them most mysteriously,\n\"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?\""

I walked by a Guernsey cow,\nWho directed me down to the Bowery slums,\nWhere people carried signs around saying \"Ban the bums\".\nI jumped right into line, saying, \"I hope that I'm not late,\"\nWhen I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.\n\nI went into a restaurant looking for the cook.\nI told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.\nThe waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.\nI ordered some Suzette. I said, \"Could you please make that crepe?\"\nJust then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.\nFood was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.\n\nNow, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank\nTo get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.\nThey asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.\nThey threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,\nWho invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend\nWho knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.\n\nWell, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.\nI said, \"Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way.\"\nThe man says, \"Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!\"\nI said, \"You know, they refused Jesus too.\" He said, \"You're not Him!\nGet out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!\"\nI decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.\n\nI ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,\nI went out the other door, this Englishman said \"Fab!\"\nAs he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood\nParked across from a building advertising brotherhood.\nI ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,\nBut it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.\n\nI repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.\nHe gave me his card, he said, \"Call me if they die.\"\nI shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street\nWhen a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.\nA pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.\nWhen I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.\n\nWell, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab\nAt bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.\nI decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails\nWould let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.\nSo, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.\nIt came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.\n\nWell, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.\nI was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.\nThey asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.\nThey believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.\nI said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.\nThey let me go right away - they were very paranoid.\n\nWell, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale\nThat was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.\nBut the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,\nI saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.\nI asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.\nHe said his name was Columbus. I just said \"Good luck\"."

Eliot fighting in the captain's tower\nWhile Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers\nBetween the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow\nAnd nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.\n\nYes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.\nWhen you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?\nAll these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,\nI had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.\nRight now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!\nNot unless you mail them from Desolation Row."

It's so hard to get on.\nAnd these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.\n\nInside the museums infinity goes up on trial,\nVoices echo, \"This is what salvation must be like after a while\",\nBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.\nSee the primitive wallflower freeze\nWhen the jelly-faced women all sneeze.\nHear the one with the mustache say, \"Jeez,\nI can't find my knees.\"\nOh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,\nBut these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.\n\nThe peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,\nSaying, \"Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him.\"\nBut, like Louise always says, \"You can't look at much, can you, man?\" as she herself prepares for him.\nAnd Madonna, she still has not showed,\nWe see this empty cage now corrode\nWhere her cape of the stage once had flowed,\nThe fiddler, he now steps to the road,\nHe writes \"Everything's been returned which was owed\"\nOn the back of the fish truck that loads\nWhile my conscience explodes.\nThe harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain\nAnd these visions of Johanna are now all that remain."

My loss will be your gain.\"\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,\nBut with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.\n\"Could you please not stare at me like that?\" he said, \"It's just my foolish pride,\nBut sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide.\"\n\nWell, Judas, he just winked and said, \"Alright, I'll leave you here.\nBut, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear.\"\n\"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be.\"\nJudas pointed down the road and said, \"Eternity.\"\n\"Eternity?\" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.\n\"That's right,\" said Judas, \"Eternity, though you might call it paradise.\"\n\"I don't call it anything,\" said Frankie Lee with a smile.\n\"Alright,\" said Judas Priest, \"I'll see you after a while.\"\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean\nWhen just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,\nSaying, \"Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?\nWell, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest.\"\n\"Oh, yes, he is my friend,\" said Frankie Lee in fright.\n\"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight.\"\n\"Yes, that's the one,\" said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.\n\"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house.\"\nWell, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran\nUntil he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.\n\"What kind of house is this,\" he said, \"where I have come to roam?\"\n\"It's not a house,\" says Judas Priest. \"It's not a house, it's a home.\"\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control\nOver everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.\nHe just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun\nWith four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.\nWell, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap\nAnd, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.\nFor sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst\nInto the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.\nNo one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -\nExcept of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,\nAnd he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed\nAnd muttered underneath his breath, \"Nothing is revealed.\"\n\nWell, the moral of the story, the moral of this song\nIs simply that one should never be where one does not belong.\nSo, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load\nAnd don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road."

  "text": "The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,\nAnyone with any sense had already left town;\nHe was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.\n\nHe moved across the mirrored room, \"Set it up for everyone,\" he said,\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,\nAnd he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,\n\"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?\"\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.\n\nBackstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,\nLily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.\nOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,\nA gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,\nLily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.\n\nBig Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,\nHe made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.\n\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,\nShe slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,\n\"Sorry, darling, that I'm late,\" but he didn't seem to hear:\nHe was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.\n\nI know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,\nMaybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,\nStaring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.\n\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.\nShe had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\nWith men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,\nBut she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.\n\nThe hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,\nThe drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -\nNo, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.\n\nRosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,\nWas looking to do just one good deed before she died -\nShe was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.\n\nLily took her dress off, buried it away,\n\"Has your luck run out?\" she laughed at him, \"Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.\nBe careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,\nI'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint.\"\nDown the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.\n\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,\n\"There's something funny going on,\" he said, \"I can just feel it in the air.\"\nHe went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.\n\nNo one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked\nAnd Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -\nShe was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.\n\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\nFor one more member, who had business back in town,\nFor they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.\n\nThe next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,\nThe hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,\nThe only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.\n\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said \"Closed for Repair\",\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\nShe was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,\nThinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,\nBut most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts."

Now ain't the time for your tears.\n\nHattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,\nShe was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,\nWho carried the dishes and took out the garbage\nAnd never sat once at the head of the table\nAnd didn't even talk to the people at the table,\nWho just cleaned up all the food from the table\nAnd emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,\nGot killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane\nThat sailed through the air and came down through the room,\nDoomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,\nAnd she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.\nAnd you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,\nTake the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.\n\nIn the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel\nTo show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level\nAnd that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded\nAnd that even the nobles get properly handled\nOnce that the cops have chased after and caught 'em\nAnd that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,\nStared at the person who killed for no reason,\nWho just happened to be feeling that way without warning,\nAnd he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,\nAnd handed out strongly for penalty and repentance\nWilliam Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.\nAh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,\nBury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears."

I felt I'd been had\nWhen I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,\nWhen I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.\n\nI picked up his body and I dragged him inside,\nThrew him down in the hole, I put back the cover.\nI said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,\nThen I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.\n\nShe was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,\nBlinded by sleep and in need of a bed.\nI came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,\nI cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.\n\nShe said, \"Where you been?\" I said, \"No place special.\"\nShe said, \"You look different.\" I said, \"Well, I guess.\"\nShe said, \"You been gone.\" I said, \"That's only natural.\"\nShe said, \"You gonna stay?\" I said, \"If you want me to, yes!\"\n\nIsis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,\nWhat drives me to you is what drives me insane,\nI still can remember the way that you smiled\nOn the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain."

but I just can't get it outta my head -\nBut I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.\nAll I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved\nAnd a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love.\n\nWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,\nI was crossing the street when shots rang out.\nI didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.\n\"We got him cornered in the churchyard!\" I heard somebody shout.\n\nWell, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,\nUnderneath it it said, \"A man with no alibi\".\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.\nThen, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do.\n\nNow, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,\nBut sometimes you just find yourself over the line.\nOh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,\nYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.\nI could feel a whole lot better\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how.\n\nWell, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,\nYeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.\nHe's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,\nBut I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love.\n\nYou know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter \nIs that his name wasn't Henry Porter.\nAnd, you know, there was something about you, baby,\nThat I liked, that was always too good for this world.\nJust like you always said, there was something about me you liked \nThat I left in the French Quarter.\n\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections \nThan people who are most content.\nI don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.\nYou always said people don't do what they believe in,\nThey just do what's most convenient, then they repent.\nAnd I always said, \"Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on.\"\n\nThere was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,\nI don't remember who I was or where I was bound,\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,\nHe wore a gun and he was shot in the back.\nSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love."

Judge says, \"That's just what you get.\"\nHe did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,\nThey threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,\nHis closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand\nWhat it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.\nThey let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,\nHe dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did - lost a little weight.\nHe tried to find a way back into where he left behind,\nTo the boss he said, \"I have returned and now I want what's mine.\"\n\nJoey, Joey,\nKing of the streets, child of clay,\nJoey, Joey,\nWhy did they have to come blow you away?\n\nIt's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:\n\"I'm around too many children,\" he said, \"they should never know of one.\"\nYet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe\nAnd emptied out the register, said, \"Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe.\"\nOne day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,\nHe could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.\nHe pushed the table over to protect his family,\nThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.\n\nJoey, Joey,\nKing of the streets, child of clay,\nJoey, Joey,\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\n\nSister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,\nI heard his best friend, Frankie, say, \"He ain't dead, he's just asleep\",\nThen I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -\nI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.\nThe sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,\nThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.\nSomeday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,\nI know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.\n\nJoey, Joey,\nKing of the streets, child of clay,\nJoey, Joey,\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?"

And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called \"Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie\".\n\nUm, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,\nWhen you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,\nWhen you're lagging behind and losing your pace\nIn the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,\nNo matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,\nIf the wine don't come to the top of your cup,\nIf the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,\nAnd your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,\nAnd the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,\nAnd your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,\nAnd you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day,\nAnd tomorrow's morning seems so far away,\nAnd you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,\nAnd your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,\nAnd your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\nTurn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,\nAnd your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,\nAnd the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,\nAnd the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,\nAnd your whole world's a-slamming and banging,\nAnd your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say,\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way.\nWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born?\"\nAnd you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,\nAnd you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,\nAnd you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,\nAnd the whole world's watching with the \"window-peek\" stare,\nAnd your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,\nAnd your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,\nAnd your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -\nBut you need it badly and it lays on the street,\nAnd your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,\nAnd you think your ears mighta been hurt\nOr your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterday's rush\nWhen you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush\nAnd all the time you're holding the three queens,\nIt's making you mad, it's making you mean,\nLike in the middle of Life magazine,\nBouncing around a pinball machine,\nAnd there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,\nThat somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,\nBut it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head\nAnd it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,\nAnd, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,\nAnd you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,\nAnd your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,\nAnd your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,\nAnd his jaws start closing with you underneath,\nAnd you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,\nYou say to yourself, \"Just what am I doing\nOn this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,\nOn this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,\nIn this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?\nAm I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?\nWhy am I walking? Where am I running?\nWhat am I saying? What am I knowing\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,\nOn this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,\nIn the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,\nIn the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?\nWho am I helping? What am I breaking?\nWhat am I giving? What am I taking?\"\nBut you try with your whole soul,\nBest never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,\nOr make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\n'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping\nAnd you fear they might catch you sleeping,\nAnd you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,\nAnd you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming,\nAnd you know that it's something special you're needing,\nYou know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,\nNeed something special-need something special, alright,\nYou need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back,\nYou need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler\nThat's been banging and booming and blowing forever,\nThat knows your troubles a hundred times over,\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,\nThat won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,\nAnd, by any number of bets in the book,\nWill be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,\nYou need something to open up a new door,\nTo show you something you seen before\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more,\nYou need something to open your eyes,\nYou need something to make it known\nThat it's you and no one else that owns\nThat spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,\nThat the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,\nIt can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,\nYou need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,\nBut hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard\nOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,\nBut that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,\nAnd your trouble is you know it too good\n'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,\n'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,\nAnd it ain't on Macy's window-sill,\nAnd it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,\nAnd it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,\nAnd it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,\nAnd it ain't on that dim-lit stage\nWith that half-wit comedian on it,\nRanting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,\nNo, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,\nAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper club,\nAnd, sure as hell, you're bound to tell\nThat, no matter how hard you rub,\nYou just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,\nNo, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,\nAnd ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,\nIt ain't in the cardboard-box house,\nOr down any movie star's blouse,\nAnd you can't find it on the golf course,\nAnd Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,\nAnd it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,\nAin't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,\nAnd ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices\nThat come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,\nSaying, \"Ain't I pretty?\" and, \"Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,\nLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,\nLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,\"\nWhen you can't even sense has it got any insides?\nThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,\nNo, you'll not now or no other day\nFind it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,\nAnd inside it with the people made of molasses\nThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,\nAnd it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,\nWho'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack,\nAnd, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,\nBut this time behind your back, my friend,\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world,\nAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\nThat run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,\nAnd ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do\nAnd think they're fooling you,\nThe ones that jump on the wagon\nJust for a while 'cause they know it's in style\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick,\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks,\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,\nSaying, \"Christ, do I gotta be like that?\nAin't there no one here that knows where I'm at?\nAin't there no one here that knows how I feel?\nGood God Almighty, that stuff ain't real.\"\nNo, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,\nCan't hear your name, you can't see your face,\nYou gotta look some other place,\nAnd where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,\nWhere do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,\nWhere do you look for this oil-well gushing,\nWhere do you look for this candle that's glowing,\nWhere do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?\nAnd your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,\nYour eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,\nYour nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,\nYou can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,\nYou can either go to the church of your choice,\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,\nYou find God in the church of your choice,\nYou find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\nAnd, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,\nYou'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown."

  "text": "In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,\nWhen the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,\nThere's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,\nToiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.\nDon't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,\nLike Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.\nIn the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand\nIn every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.\n\nOh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,\nLike criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,\nThe sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,\nTo ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.\nI gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame\nAnd, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.\nThen, onward in my journey, I come to understand\nThat every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.\n\nI have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,\nIn the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,\nIn the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,\nIn the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.\nI hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,\nSometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.\nI am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan\nLike every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand."

  "text": "Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,\nWondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.\nHer folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,\nThey never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.\nAnd I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,\nHeading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,\nTangled up in blue.\n\nShe was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.\nWe drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,\nSplit up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.\nShe turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,\nI heard her say over my shoulder, \"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,\nTangled up in blue.\"\n\nI had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,\nBut I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,\nWorking for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,\nBut all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,\nI seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew\nTangled up in blue.\n\nShe was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,\nI just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,\nAnd later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,\nShe was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, \"Don't I know your name?\"\nI muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,\nI must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,\nTangled up in blue.\n\nShe lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.\n\"I thought you'd never say hello,\" she said, \"You look like the silent type.\"\nThen she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,\nWritten by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,\nAnd every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,\nPouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,\nTangled up in blue.\n\nI lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,\nThere was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,\nThen he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,\nShe had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,\nAnd when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,\nThe only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,\nTangled up in blue.\n\nSo now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,\nAll the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.\nSome are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,\nDon't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,\nBut me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,\nWe always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,\nTangled up in blue."

Don't forget that you are white.\"\n\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, \"I'm really not sure.\"\nThe cops said, \"A poor boy like you could use a break -\nWe got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,\nIf you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.\nYou'll be doing society a favor,\nThat son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.\nWe wanna put his ass in the stir,\nWe wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'.\"\n\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch,\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much.\n\"It's my work,\" he'd say, \"and I do it for pay\nAnd, when it's over, just as soon go on my way\"--\nUp into some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along the trail,\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.\n\nAll of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:\nThe judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger,\nAnd, though they could not produce the gun,\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.\n\nRubin Carter was falsely tried,\nThe crime was murder one, guess who testified?\n--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,\nThe newspapers, they all went along for the ride.\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fool's hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.\n\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,\nAn innocent man in a living hell.\nYes, that's the story of the \"Hurricane\",\nBut it won't be over till they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time he's done,\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world."

  "text": "Well, there was this movie I seen one time\nAbout a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.\nHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.\nThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.\n\nWell, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp\nAs the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.\n\"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.\nI want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.\"\n\nWell, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in\nAnd, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.\nYou know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,\nThe memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.\n\nI can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert\nIn your busted down Ford and your platform heels.\nI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -\nAh, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.\n\nWell, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'\nAnd we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.\nWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.\nI would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.\n\nWell, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -\nNow, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,\nBut I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore\nTo remember the times when I was your only man\nAnd she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love.\n\nWell, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -\nHe owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,\nShe saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.\nShe says, \"Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while.\"\n\nThen she told us how times were tough \nAnd about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,\nBut she changed the subject every time money came up.\nShe said, \"Welcome to the land of the living dead\",\nBut you could tell she was so broken-hearted,\nShe said, \"Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt.\"\n\n\"How far are you all going?\" Ruby asked us with a sigh.\n\"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,\nTill the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies.\"\nRuby just smiled and said, \"Ah, you know some babies never learn.\"\n\nSomething about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -\nBut I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.\nAll I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved\nAnd a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love.\n\nWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,\nI was crossing the street when shots rang out.\nI didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.\n\"We got him cornered in the churchyard!\" I heard somebody shout.\n\nWell, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,\nUnderneath it it said, \"A man with no alibi\".\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.\nThen, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do.\n\nNow, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,\nBut sometimes you just find yourself over the line.\nOh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,\nYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.\nI could feel a whole lot better\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how.\n\nWell, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,\nYeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.\nHe's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,\nBut I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love.\n\nYou know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter \nIs that his name wasn't Henry Porter.\nAnd, you know, there was something about you, baby,\nThat I liked, that was always too good for this world.\nJust like you always said, there was something about me you liked \nThat I left in the French Quarter.\n\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections \nThan people who are most content.\nI don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.\nYou always said people don't do what they believe in,\nThey just do what's most convenient, then they repent.\nAnd I always said, \"Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on.\"\n\nThere was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,\nI don't remember who I was or where I was bound,\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,\nHe wore a gun and he was shot in the back.\nSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above,\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world,\nBrownsville girl, you're my honey, love."

  "text": "Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,\nEverybody knows that baby's got new clothes,\nBut lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.\nShe takes just like a woman - yes, she does!\nShe makes love like a woman - yes, she does!\nAnd she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.\n\nQueen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,\nNobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed\nTill she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.\nShe takes just like a woman - yes, she does!\nShe makes love like a woman - yes, she does!\nAnd then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.\n\nIt was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.\nAnd your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.\nI can't stay in here - ain't it clear\nThat I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.\nBut, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,\nPlease don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.\nYou fake just like a woman - yes, you do!\nYou make love like a woman - yes, you do!\nAnd then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl."

It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch.\"\nJuliet said back to Romeo, \"Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?\"\n\nThey got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.\nThey went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.\n\nIf you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.\nI'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.\n\nMy grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,\nMy grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.\n\nI had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,\nI left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.\n\nNot always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.\nSometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask."

I felt I've been had\nWhen I saw that my partner was just being friendly,\nWhen I took up his offer, I must've been mad.\n\nI picked up his body and I dragged him inside,\nThrew him down in the hole and I put back the cover.\nI said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,\nThen I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.\n\nShe was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,\nBlinded by sleep and in need of a bed.\nI came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,\nI cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.\n\nShe said, \"Where you been?\" I said, \"No place special.\"\nShe said, \"You look a-different.\" I said, \"Well, I guess.\"\nShe said, \"You been gone.\" I said, \"That's only natural.\"\nShe said, \"You gonna stay?\" I said, \"If you want me to, yes!\"\n\nIsis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,\nWhat drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,\nI still can remember the way that you smiled\nOn the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain."

Don't forget, now, you are white.\"\n\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, \"I'm really not sure.\"\nThe cops said, \"A poor boy like you could use a break -\nWe got you for that motel job. We were talking to your friend, Bello,\nYou don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.\nYou'll be doing society a favor,\nThat son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.\nWe wanna put his ass in stir,\nWe wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'.\"\n\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch,\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much.\n\"It's my work,\" he'd say, \"and I do it for the pay.\nWhen it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way\"--\nUp into some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along the trail,\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.\n\nAll of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:\nThe judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger,\nThough they could not produce the gun,\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.\n\nRubin Carter was a-falsely tried,\nCrime was murder one and guess who testified?\n--Arthur Dexter Bradley and Bello and they both lied\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fool's hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.\n\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,\nAn innocent man in a living hell.\nThat's the story of the \"Hurricane\",\nBut it won't be over till they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time he's done,\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world."

This is a fictitious story.\n\nWell, I was feeling sad and kind of blue,\nI didn't know what I was gonna do.\nThe Communists were coming around,\nThey were in the air, they were on the ground,\nThey were all over!\n\nSo I ran down most hurriedly\nAnd joined the John Birch Society,\nI got me a secret membership card,\nWent back to my backyard,\nStarting look on the sidewalk,\n'Neath the rose bush.\n\nWell, I was looking everywhere for them god-darned Reds,\nI got up in the morning, looked under my bed,\nLooked behind the kitchen, behind the door,\nEven tore loose the kitchen floor.\nI couldn't find any.\n\nI looked beneath the sofa, beneath the chair,\nLooking for them Reds everywhere.\nI looked way up my chimney-hole,\nEven deep down inside my toilet bowl.\nThey got away!\n\nI heard some footsteps by the front porch door,\nSo I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,\nI snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,\nSaying, \"Hands up, you Communists!\"\nIt was the mailman!\nHe punched me out!\n\nWell, I quit my job so I could work alone,\nI got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,\nFollowed some clues from my detective bag,\nI discovered there was red stripes in the American flag!\nDid you know about Betty Ross?\n\nWell, I was sitting home alone and I started to sweat,\nI figured they was in my television set!\nI peeked behind the picture frame\nAnd got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.\nThem Reds did it,\nThe ones on Hootenanny!\n\nWell, I finally started thinking straight\nWhen I run outta things to investigate.\nI couldn't imagine doing anything else,\nSo now I'm home investigating myself!\nHope I don't find out too much!\nGood God!\n\nWho cares?"

Just do what you think you should do.\nAnd someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you."

Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!\nFriend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,\nYou look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.\nJokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird, fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nWell, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,\nThe law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.\nIn the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,\nMichelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.\nResting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,\nHalf asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.\nJokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird, fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nWell, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,\nPreacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.\nNight-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,\nMolotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.\nFalse-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,\nOnly a matter of time till night comes stepping in.\nJokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird, fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman.\n\nIt's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,\nA woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.\nHe'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,\nTake the motherless children off the street,\nAnd place them at the feet of a harlot.\nOh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,\nOh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.\nJokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,\nBird, fly high by the light of the moon,\nOh, oh, oh, Jokerman."
